      <p className="bit4"> 
      Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.12 The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms do, and unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.


      Bitcoin is known as a type of cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to keep it secure. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to (although each record is encrypted). All Bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power via a process known as "mining." Bitcoin is not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender in most parts of the world, Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as BTC when traded.</p>

        Almost 30,000 Bitcoin millionaires have been wiped in the last three
        months as the volatile cryptocurrency is witnessing a free fall -- from
        $69,000 in November to nearly $36,000 (as of Thursday) â€” owing to
        regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical unrest. According to data acquired
        by financial news portal Finbold, between October and January, the
        number of Bitcoin addresses holding over $1 million has reduced by
        28,186 or 24.26 per cent.
